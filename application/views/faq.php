			<h4>What is this site?</h4>
			<p>We here at Sports Stat Grab are avid sports fans.  As fans, we were always searching for random stats on sports but we never found an easy, quick way.  We would always have to navigate through various links and sort.  The process was just too long.  So we did what good fans do, we created a website for you to grab data with a relatively easy format.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'answer' id ='answer2'>
			<h4>How far back does the data go?</h4>
			<p>Currently, our NFL data goes back about 10 years to the 2003 season.  We think that is a good amount of time for a sample of modern day football.If there are enough demands though, we can go back a few more years for you guys, no problem! </p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'answer' id ='answer3'>
			<h4>How come there is it is only NFL data?  Will there be any other sports data?</h4>
			<p>The NFL's popularity seems to be growing every year and with a minimal amount of games, it felt like a good place to being our stat grabbing.  Eventually, if all goes well, we will have for you other sports data for you to grab (NBA, MLB, NHL, etc...)</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'answer' id ='answer4'>
			<h4>I can't find the player/stat I'm looking for, where is it?</h4>
			<p>
				Would it shock you if we told you we were fantasy sports junkies too?  That is why we decided to only display statistics from players who are fantasy-relevant.  But if you feel there should be a player or stat that you would like to see, please feel free to <a href='/welcome/contact'>contact us</a> and let us know.  
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class = 'answer' id ='answer5'>
			<h4>I bet according to the stats, how come I lost?</h4>
			<p>
				This is a good one. Where do we begin?  Our intent here is not to promote sports wagering, but it is to provide you with data that we feel you, as a sports enthusiast, might like to know.   But if you feel a need to use the stat grabs for sports wagering, please do it responsibly and legally.  As we've often heard in our lives, the old adage of "Past performance does not indicate future results."  So keep that in mind as you're looking at the stat grab and have fun!

			<h4>I see a wrong stat, what do i do?</h4>
			<p>
				Blasted!  If you happen to find or spot a wrong stat, please shoot us a <a href='/welcome/contact'>comment</a> right away and we'll get it fixed as soon as possible.  For the most part we believe everything is very accurate, but it is possible that a minor inconsistency exists in such a huge pool of data.  Thank you for keeping a keen eye out for us.

			<h4>The stat grabs are taking really long, whats going on?</h4>
			<p>
				As we're growing here at Sports Stat Grab, we are trying to figure out how much internet space we need (and how to pay for it).  As the number of users and stat grabs grow (hopefully), we will grow also!  Please bear with us as we adjust to demand and know that we are trying 100% to make your experience pleasant and smooth.
